# 🚀 DSA + Generative AI Journey

**Hi, I'm Akamal Shaikh!** 👋  
I am a 2nd-year Computer Engineering student at **ISBM College of Engineering, Pune (SPPU)**.

This repository documents my daily progress in **Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)** and **Generative AI Engineering**, following the roadmap by **Rohit Negi**.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- **Master DSA:** Solving 300+ problems in C++ to build strong problem-solving logic.
- **GenAI Engineering:** Moving beyond APIs to build Agents, RAG pipelines, and Vector DB integrations.
- **Consistency:** Committing code daily/weekly to track growth.
